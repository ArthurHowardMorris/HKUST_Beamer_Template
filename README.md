# HKUST_Beamer_Template
Beamer Template for HKUST

The color definitions:
```latex
\definecolor{ustgold}{RGB}{153, 102, 0}
```
and 
``` latex
\definecolor{ustblue}{RGB}{0, 51, 102}
```
are from page 71 of the [HKUST Brand Guidelines](https://pao.ust.hk/Bdownload/HKUST_Brand_guideline.pdf)

The logos are all from the [HKUST Media Technology and Publishing Center](https://logo.ust.hk/downloads/)

# Outstanding issues:
	
- The colors defined in the brand guidelines do not match the colors in the logos
- The logos are not particularly high resolution
